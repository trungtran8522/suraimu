Urizen
======

Urizen is the roguelike dungeon generation library written on Python3. It has various algorithms that can be used to generate maps on scale of single rooms to the whole world.

**Note: This project is on early stage of development. It can contain bugs, API breaking changes and lack of documentation.**

Features
--------

- Two main collections - generators and visualizers - that can be used in any variations.
- Easy-to-use map objects with no need of additional libraries.
- Modular architecture that allows simple extension.

Simple example
--------------

.. code:: python

    # Import this library
    import urizen as uz

    # Create a 50x50 size map using BSP algorithm
    M = uz.dungeon_bsp_tree(50, 50)

    # And visualize it using Pillow with Urizen tileset
    uz.vg_tiled(M, scale=3)


The result image will be automatically opened with a default image viewer.
